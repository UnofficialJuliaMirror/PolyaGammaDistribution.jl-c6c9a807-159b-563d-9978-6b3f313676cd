# What is this?

This repository is still under rapid and active development, but when it's done it will provide tools for sampling from and computing moments of the Pólya-Gamma distribution, as described in [this paper by Polson et al](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2013.829001). They provide the [BayesLogit R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesLogit/index.html) which my code at the moment essentially copies from, hence the GPL license.


# What is the point of this?

Suppose we have some function, often some sort of distance between two points, that outputs a real value. We'd like a probability, so we push it through a function that squashes from 0 to 1. Often the logistic aka sigmoid function is used, as in logistic regression or the common activations on the end of a neural network. This is an easy thing to do, although it usually ends up requiring some kind of numerical method to maximize the output.

However, if you have a model where you'd like to use a sampler to approximate a posterior distribution (rather than just maximizing) then it becomes much trickier. The Polson et al paper lays out an efficient scheme for sampling in these situations by adding some Pólya-Gamma distributed latent variables.

# Acknowledgments, etc.

Apologies to George Pólya for misspelling his name, but it seemed like putting non-ASCII characters in a package/module name was asking for trouble down the line.
